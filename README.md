# Preparing Envirnoment and Running the project locally

## Configuring API keys before cloning the repository
### Placement of Secret keys
Some services need secret keys for functioning:
1. Github bot- You need to set Github private key in the app.
2. Firebase Admin- You need to set firebase admin private in order to work with firebase admin.
3. Firebase rest API- Set firebase project API key and base URL for working with firebase storage and firebase real time database  
<br /> 

**Note:** For __Desktop__ put these files in a folder named [SecretFiles](https://github.com/NaveedAhmadHematmal/VaccineApp/tree/main/src/VaccineApp/SecretFiles/readme.md) in VaccineApp project and for __Web__ put them in [SecretFiles](https://github.com/NaveedAhmadHematmal/VaccineApp/blob/main/src/Web/VaccineApp.BlazorPWA/VaccineApp.BlazorPWA/wwwroot/SecretFiles/readme.md)

### Application Development and production Environments
There exist two options to work with firebase; online (for production), offline (for development). For switching between offline and online mode, change the value of [AppConfigs](https://github.com/NaveedAhmadHematmal/VaccineApp/blob/main/src/VaccineApp/AppConfigs/AppSettings.json) to online or offline for __Desktop__ and for __Web__ go to this [Link](https://github.com/NaveedAhmadHematmal/VaccineApp/blob/main/src/Web/VaccineApp.BlazorPWA/VaccineApp.BlazorPWA/wwwroot/AppConfigs/AppSettings.json).
